Library Book Management System


1B: Library Book Management System:

Implemented the Library Book Management System, with the frontend GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database using SQLite.

It is a single window tkinter GUI application which implements CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations on a ‘books’ database, in SQLite. The window contains text widgets to accept / display book title, author, year of publication, ISBN (optional) and a large text area/ list box to display the records which match the search criteria.
